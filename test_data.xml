      Dear Developer, the WURFL file contains information about the
      capabilities of mobile devices, capabilities and features.
      The main scope of this file is to collect as
      many information as we can about all the existing wireless devices
      that access mobile pages so that developers will be able to build better
      applications and better services for the users.
      This project is open-source and is intended for developers working
      with the WAP environment. All the information listed here has been
